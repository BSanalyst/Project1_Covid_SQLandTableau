## My First Project, solo!

In this project, inspired by AlexTheAnalyst, I investigated COVID data from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus (the entire data set can be downloaded here).
I chose to work with 3 sub sections of the entire dataset: Deaths, Infections (cases), and Tests. 

In SQL I utilised aggregations, CTEs, and joins to gain the insights. To understand the data's metrics, and their conclusions, visit: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data for details.

I created visualisations in Tableau from the dataset: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.stringer/viz/COVIDProjectSolo/Dashboard1.
Here I display a drill down effect. Global data, data by continent, data by location.
